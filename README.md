<p>If you've been using Shopify for long enough, you might have noticed that managing collections can be stressful. Especially when you have 50+ collections, with thousands of SKUs, the Shopify Admin UI doesn't quite cut it when you want to check something at a glance. User experience is paramount, and users don't want to land on empty collection pages or even worse, a collection page full of out of stock products.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a theme section to solve many issues that I come across while managing collections across all Shopify stores that I manage, regardless of theme used. Which is why I created Collection Hawk. This section is a front-end analysis tool for Shopify stores that want to see important details about all of their collections/products in one convenient place.</p>

<p>No more manual audits of collections, checking to see if every collection has products, and a picture, and a description. On top of that, <b>no more solutions that you have to pay for</b>!</p>

<p>This theme section is 100% open-source and available for anyone to use for free.</p>

<h3>Main Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Toggle any of the below configurations on or off as needed,</li>
  <li>Choose between a single list view or sorted tab view,</li>
